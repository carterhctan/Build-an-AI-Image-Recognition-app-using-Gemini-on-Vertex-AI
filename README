Objective
Generative AI on Vertex AI (also known as genAI or gen AI) gives you access to Google's large generative AI models so you can test, tune, and deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications. In this lab, you will:

Connect to Vertex AI (Google Cloud AI platform): Learn how to establish a connection to Google's AI services using the Vertex AI SDK.
Load a pre-trained generative AI model -Gemini: Discover how to use a powerful, pre-trained AI model without building one from scratch.
Send image + text questions to the AI model: Understand how to provide input for the AI to process.
Extract text-based answers from the AI: Learn to handle and interpret the text responses generated by the AI model.
Understand the basics of building AI applications: Gain insights into the core concepts of integrating AI into software projects.
Working with Vertex AI Python SDK
After starting the lab, you will get a split pane view consisting of the Code Editor on the left side and the lab instructions on the right side. Follow these steps to interact with the Generative AI APIs using Vertex AI Python SDK.
